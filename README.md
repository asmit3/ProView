Protein Visualization Software developed with Eugene Yedvabny in Fall 2014. 

ProView: Visual Exploratory Analysis of Protein Structure
Description

ProView is an interactive visualizer for protein structure and numerical properties. It was designed to aid researchers during the exploratory phase of their projects as they try to correlate some numerical properties with the 3D structure of their model.

Underlying technologies

ProView is built on Boostrap, D3, and a modified version of iview WebGL protein visualizer.
